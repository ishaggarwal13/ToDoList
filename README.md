# To-Do List Web Application using MERN Stack

This project is a web-based TO-DO List application developed using the MERN stack, allowing users to effortlessly create, categorize, and track tasks. The objective is to provide a unified platform for streamlined task management. The project works on the principles of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Below are some available scripts to help you get started:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project so you have full control over them. At this point, you're on your own. You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.

## Design & Testing

The design phase of the TO-DO List application project was instrumental in bridging the gap between identified software requirements and a cohesive, visually pleasing user interface. This section delineates the fundamental design considerations, encompassing tables' structures, relationships, as well as flowcharts and pseudo code to outline the application's logical progression.

### Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the TO-DO List application:

### Tables and Their Relationships

Given that the scope of the project predominantly focused on front-end development, the complexity of the database structure was relatively modest. Nonetheless, a conceptual illustration of data flow and relationships was orchestrated to elucidate interactions among distinct components.

#### Task Data Table

- Fields: Task Input, All To-dos, Active To-dos, Done Todos, add new To-do, Delete To-dos
- Relationships: N/A (Front-end interaction only)

### Flowcharts and Pseudo Code

To visualize the chronological sequence of actions and user engagements, the utilization of flowcharts was pivotal in plotting the application's process flow. In parallel, the employment of pseudo code enabled the delineation of coherent logical steps that would be followed during task processing and management. The fusion of flowcharts and pseudo code illuminated the seamless trajectory from initial user input to the eventual display of organized tasks.

#### Flowchart Steps:

1. User inputs task title, description, done task, active task, and all to-dos.
2. User clicks "Add Task" button.
3. Application processes input data and integrates the task into the task list.
4. The updated task list is reflected on the user interface.
